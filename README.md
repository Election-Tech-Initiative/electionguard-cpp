# üó≥ ElectionGuard C++

This repository is a "reference implementation" of an ElectionGuard ballot encryption library written in c++ and includes a C-compatible API for referencing the library from pure-c application.  This core SDK performs ballot encryption and verification functions and is suitable for execution on voting system hardware and low powered devices.  It is designed to be integrated into existing (or new) voting system software.  

This repository is `pre-release` software to showcase the ElectionGuard API implemented in a native language.  It is not feature complete and should not be used for production applications.

## ‚ùì What Is ElectionGuard?

ElectionGuard is an open source software development kit (SDK) that makes voting more secure, transparent and accessible. The ElectionGuard SDK leverages homomorphic encryption to ensure that votes recorded by electronic systems of any type remain encrypted, secure, and secret. Meanwhile, ElectionGuard also allows verifiable and accurate tallying of ballots by any 3rd party organization without compromising secrecy or security.

## ü¶∏ How Can I use ElectionGuard?

ElectionGuard supports a variety of use cases.  The Primary use case is to generate verifiable end-to-end (E2E) encrypted elections.  The ElectionGuard process can also be used for other use cases such as privacy enhanced risk-limiting audits (RLAs).  This implementation only includes encryption functions and cannot be used to generate election keys and it cannot decrypt tally results.

This c++ implementation also includes a C API that can be consumed from anywhere that can call C code directly.  A .Net Standard package is also provided.

## üíª Requirements

### All Platforms

- A [C++17](https://isocpp.org/get-started) standard compliant compiler is required to build the core library.  While any modern compiler should work, the library is tested on a subset.  Check out the [GitHub actions](#) to see what is officially supported.
- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html) is used to simplify the commands and GitHub Actions. This approach is recommended to simplify the command line experience. This is built in for MacOS and Linux. For Windows, setup is simpler with [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install) and installing the provided [make package](https://chocolatey.org/packages/make). The other Windows option is [manually installing make](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm).
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) is used to simplify the build experience.

### ü§ñ Android

To build for android, you need the Android SDK and platforms 21 and 26.  The easiest way is to download android studio.  Alternatively, you can use the SDK installation that ships with the Xamarin Tooling in Visual Studio.  WE also require the use of the Android NDK.  Android builds can be compiled on Linux, Mac, or Windows

- [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/#downloads)
- [SDK 21](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platforms#5.0)
- [SDK 26](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platforms#8.0)
- [NDK 21](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/)

### üåê .NET

A .NET Standard binding library is provided so that this package can be consumed from C# applications.  At this time, only Android and iOS binaries are included and they can be consumed from a Xamarin application.  Building for Xamarin currently requires a Mac

- Other dependencies for Android and iOS
- [Visual Studio for Mac](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/)
- [NuGet Command Line (CLI)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/reference/nuget-exe-cli-reference#macoslinux)

### üçè iOS

To build for iOS you need XCode installed

- [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/resources/) and the [Command Line Tools for XCode](#)
- [CMake 3.19](https://cmake.org/) may be necessary, along with changes to the Makefile.  [See ISSUE #138](https://github.com/microsoft/electionguard-cpp/issues/138)

### üñ•Ô∏è Windows (using MSYS2)

Building on windows is currently supported using the `MSYS2` toolchain.  `MSVC` support will be included in a future release.

- Install [Chocolatey]()
- Install [Powershell Core](https://github.com/powershell/powershell)
- Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org)
- Open the MSYS2 prompt by running the newly-created "MSYS2 MSYS" shortcut in your start menu.
- Inside the prompt, run `pacman -Syu`, then close the window when it prompts you to.
- Reopen the MSYS2 prompt and run:
    ```
    pacman -Syu
    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake make
    ```
- Modify your `%Path%` to include the newly-installed software. You should include these two paths:
    ```
    C:\msys64\mingw64\bin
    C:\msys64\usr\bin
    ```

#### üöß The Procedure Entry Point Could not be Located

When compiling with shared libraries, you may encounter an error running the unit tests project.  This is likely due to windows resolving the incorrect implementation of `libstdc++-6.dll`.  Solving this depends on your use case, but you can either ensure that the path modifications made above appear before any other paths which include this library (e.g. c\Windows\System32\), or you can include a copy of the correct DLL in the output folder.  [See this StackOverflow post for more information](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18668003/the-procedure-entry-point-gxx-personality-v0-could-not-be-located)

## Build

Using **make**,

### To Download Dependencies

```sh
make environment
```

### Build the Library for the current host (Release)

```sh
make build
```

### Build the Library for the current host (Debug)

```sh
export TARGET=Debug && make build
```

### Build for android

The Android Build currently Targets API Level 26 but can be configured by modifying the Makefile

Set the path to the NDK, replacing the version with your own

```sh
export NDK_PATH=/Users/$USER/Library/Android/sdk/ndk/21.3.6528147 && make build-android
```

### Build for iOS

The iOS build currently targets iPhone OS 12 but can be configured by modifying the Makefile

Creates a fat binary for the simulator and targets a recent version of iOS

```sh
make build-ios
```

### Build for Windows

```pwsh
make build
```

### Build for Xamarin

Wraps the android and iOS build artifacts in a NuGet package to be consumed from a Xamarin application (classic or forms)

Must be executed on OS X to successfully built the iOS project.

```sh
make build-netstandard
```

## Test

### Running the C++ and C tests

```sh
make test
```

### Running the netstandard tests

You can run the .Net Standard tests using the Xamarin Test runner on the iOS simulator.

```sh
# ensure the iOS and Android binaries are built
make build-netstandard
```

Then, open Visual studio for Mac and run the `ElectionGuard.Tests.iOS` project.
