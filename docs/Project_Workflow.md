# Project Workflow

## ‚ú® Start an Iteration
Each iteration on this repository will be tracked by a GitHub **[Milestone](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-milestones)**. The completion of the milestone will queue a GitHub **[Release](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-releases-in-a-repository)**. Issues will be added to the milestones to indicate work needed. After completion, this milestone can then act as a list of work contained within a release. 

## üîÄ Pull Request

### Attach Issue

Each pull request **MUST** be attached to an issue. On the surface, this ensures that closing a pull request will close an issue. This also ensures the issue can be included in the milestone.  

### Validation

Each pull request is validated by the [Pull Request Validation](https://github.com/microsoft/electionguard-python/blob/main/.github/workflows/pull_request.yml) GitHub [Action](https://help.github.com/en/actions). This action can be viewed from the PR or from the actions to inspect the details. 

### Review

All pull requests require a review from a **Contributor** but all reviewers are welcome.

## üèÅ Create a Release

At the end of an iteration (aka when a milestone is complete), a release can be created. 

### Steps

1. Raise version number in `CMakeLists.txt`
2. Close Milestone 
3. Edit Release details _(optional)_

### Release Workflow

The release workflow is not yet implemented.
